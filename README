NAME
    Text::FindIndent - Heuristically determine the indent style

SYNOPSIS
      use Text::FindIndent;
      my $indentation_type = Text::FindIndent->parse($text);
      if ($indentation_type =~ /^s(\d+)/) {
        print "Indentation with $1 spaces\n";
      }
      elsif ($indentation_type =~ /^t(\d+)/) {
        print "Indentation with $1 tabs\n";
      }
      elsif ($indentation_type =~ /^m(\d+)/) {
        print "Indentation with $1 characters in tab/space mixed mode\n";
      }
      else {
        print "Indentation style unknown\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This is an experimental distribution that attempts to intuit the
    underlying indent "policy" for a text file (most likely a source code
    file).

METHODS
  parse
    The class method "parse" tries to determine the indentation style of the
    given piece of text (which must start at a new line and can be passed in
    either as a string or as a reference to a scalar containing the string).

    Returns a letter followed by a number. If the letter is "s", then the
    text is most likely indented with spaces. The number indicates the
    number of spaces used for indentation. A "t" indicates tabs, a "u"
    indicates that the indenation style could not be determined.

    Finally, an "m" followed by a number means that this many characters are
    used for each indentation level, but the indentation is an arbitrary
    number of tabs followed by 0-7 spaces. This can happen if your editor is
    stupid enough to do smart indentation/whitespace compression. (I.e.
    replaces all indentations many tabs as possible but leaves the rest as
    spaces.)
